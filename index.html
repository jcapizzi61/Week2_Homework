        <p>Shoppers can expect to see shelves at their local bookstores a little emptier this holiday season thanks to the ongoing <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22687960/book-shortage-paper-ink-printing-labor-explained">supply chain crisis.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Devon Dunn has worked at Book Culture on the Upper West Side for eight years. The senior manager and principal buyer of the popular New York City bookstore described facing an inventory shortage unlike anything they’ve ever seen.
        </p>

        <p>“Books that used to take three days for us to get are now taking a week,” Dunn said. “That doesn’t sound big, but that’s you know, it’s all a ripple effect.”
        </p>

        <p>The shortage is the result of a perfect storm of <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/book-shortage-news/">problems,</a> including an ongoing labor shortage, a paper shortage that has delayed printing schedules, and continued shipping and transportation problems.
        </p>

        <p>Experts have also cited increased demand as another reason why popular titles might be harder to grab in the coming months. According to NPD Bookscan, a major industry tracker, printed book sales jumped 13.2% in 2021. Most years, book sales usually see a 3-4% increase, NPD Books analyst Kristen McLean told <a href=https://www.vox.com/culture/22687960/book-shortage-paper-ink-printing-labor-explained>Vox.</a>
        </p>
    
        <p>And while a jump like this would normally be seen as a good thing, coupled with a paper shortage, book manufacturers are struggling to keep up. 
        </p>

        <p>John Beall is the East Region Sales Director for Sheridan, a printing company that manufactures books for a number of major New York publishers, including Simon & Schuster and Penguin Random House. It used to take his company five to six weeks to print and distribute an order of books. But now, a paper shortage has delayed the printing process by weeks and in some cases, months. 
        </p>

        <p>“At the last minute, in the middle to late stage of manufacturing, we're finding out that paper is not available,” he said. “And it may be available in two weeks from now. And that then throws the entire manufacturing schedule that had been planned for probably a couple months.”
        </p>

        <p>The paper shortage has been caused by a number of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/10/04/theres-still-a-paper-shortage-you-know-what-that-means/">factors</a>, including labor shortages at paper mills and the price of wood pulp, which has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU091105">skyrocketed</a> in recent months due to increased demand. 
        </p>

        <p>Beall also shared that paper mills have placed his company and other presses on a system called allocation. When presses are under allocation, they are allotted limited quantities of paper -- measured in truckloads -- to complete their queue of printing jobs. But mills are struggling to fill even limited allocation quantities, which then puts printing schedules in limbo. 
        </p>

        <p>“In recent months, since mid summer, late summer, we've seen our allocations not being fulfilled,” Beall said, citing a scenario from earlier this year when his company had been promised 18 truckloads of paper to complete an order. “All of a sudden, August rolls around and they send us ten truckloads. And we're like, well, where's the other eight? You're not going to get it.”
        </p>

        <p>As printing presses struggle to print and ship books as quickly as possible, independent bookstores like Book Culture are beginning to feel the crunch, especially when new, highly-anticipated books are having their release dates delayed weeks and even months.
        </p>

        <p>“There were a couple of titles that were due out October 5th and have now had their dates pushed back [to] November, and some even after the holidays to January, February and March,” Dunn shared. “Which is a huge decision for a publisher who would normally say ‘I’m going to release this book in October,’ which means it could be a holiday gift.”
        </p>
        
        <p>Still, at Book Culture, Dunn and their staff are doing as much as they can to get ahead of the shortage. Dunn handles the front-end ordering -- that is, ordering the new titles scheduled to be released in the coming months -- for Book Culture’s four stores. For now, they’re ordering popular titles in bulk to ensure they’re stocked during the holiday season, when the shortage is expected to get worse.
        </p>
        
        <p>Dunn also said that they and their staff are prepared to offer shoppers alternatives to titles that might not be available in the coming months. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “My staff are wonderful readers, wonderful recommenders,” Dunn said. “If you walk into our store with a person in mind, we can help you find a book to match that person.” They also suggested that shoppers begin their holiday shopping early this season, sharing that the sooner they order popular titles, the better. 

        </p>
        <p>
            While Beall and Dunn are trying to make the best of this holiday season, they both shared that it doesn’t look like the supply-chain issues plaguing the book industry will end anytime soon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “This is something we’re going to be reckoning with for a long time,” Dunn said. “It’s not just related to Covid, it’s not just related to books.”
